## **User Instructions: How to Set Up and Run the Application**  
### Prerequisites  
1. **Install Java JDK 17+** and an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.  
2. **MongoDB Setup**:  
   - Create a **MongoDB database**.  
   - Replace the `spring.data.mongodb.uri` in `application.yml` with your database's connection string.  
   - Collections and schemas will be auto-generated at runtime.  
3. **Cloudinary Account**:  
   - Create an account on **Cloudinary**.  
   - Replace the values of `cloud-name`, `api-key`, and `api-secret` in `application.yml` with your Cloudinary credentials.  
4. **Mail Configuration**:  
   - Use your email and app password for the SMTP configuration in `spring.mail`.  

### Installation Steps  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repository-url>  
   cd ecommerce  
   ```
2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash  
   mvn clean install  
   ```
3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash  
    mvn spring-boot:run  
    ```

## **Developer Instructions: How to Customize and Extend**
### Configuration Guidelines
1. **CORS Configuration**:
- Update the frontend URL in the CORS settings within SecurityConfig to allow cross-origin requests.
2. **Logging**:
- Change the logback.xml file path (Add your Folder Path) to your desired logging directory.
- Update the EcommerceApplication main file to reflect the updated path.
  ```bash
  File logsDir = new File("<your-custom-log-directory>");  
  ```
- Enable the Logback annotation for efficient logging.

### Mongo Repositories
- Update the @EnableMongoRepositories base package if you restructure the project.
  ```bash
  @EnableMongoRepositories(basePackages = "<your.package.name>")  
  ```
### Run Tests
- Execute the provided unit and integration tests using Maven:
  ```bash
  mvn test  

  ```

## **Known Issues and Limitations**  

### Potential Errors and Fixes  
1. **MongoDB Connection Errors**:  
   - Verify the URI and credentials in `application.yml`.  
   - Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.  
2. **Cloudinary Misconfiguration**:  
   - Ensure accurate account details in the `cloudinary` section of `application.yml`.  
   - Check for sufficient storage in your Cloudinary account.  
3. **SMTP Failures**:  
   - Use valid email credentials in `spring.mail`.  
   - Enable app access in your email settings if required.  
4. **CORS Errors**:  
   - Ensure the frontend URL is properly configured in the CORS settings.  

### Missing Enhancements  
- **Payment Integration**:  
  - Currently lacks a payment gateway for secure checkout functionality.  
- **Analytics and Reporting**:  
  - Missing tracking for user behavior, popular products, or sales trends.  
- **Multithreading**:
  - For parallelized image uploads and deletions via Cloudinary.
- **Soft Delete Enhancements**:
  - Ensure deleted items are invisible while maintaining a history.
- **Live Tracking**:
  - Currently missing delivery and order tracking functionality.
- **Authorization List for Admin**:
  - Replace hardcoded roles with a dynamic role-based structure.
- **Improved Database Structure**:
  - Lookup queries can reduce redundancy and optimize database design.
